        <div class="one"><p style="font-size: x-large">Ayr was created a royal burgh in 1202 (the original charter is preserved in the Town Hall) and became the garrison and court town of the administrative entity known as the sheriffdom of Ayr. During medieval times it was the chief Scottish port on the western coast until it was superseded by the developing River Clyde ports to its north. Surviving medieval relics include Loudoun Hall (16th century, restored), the town house of the Loudouns, a family that long supplied the sheriffs of Ayr. The River Ayr is still crossed by the 13th-century Auld Brig, immortalized in Burns’s poem “The Brigs of Ayr.” In the 18th century Ayr was a small town concentrated around the High Street, Sandgate, and the adjoining Vennels, but by the 19th century it had become a social centre and watering place for the Scottish gentry. After the completion of a rail link with the city of Glasgow in 1840, Ayr developed heavy engineering, metalworking, and textile industries. </p></div>

        <div class="one"><p style="font-size: x-large">Today Ayr’s most important industries include shipping and tourism. The town is a hub for service activities and serves as a local commercial centre. Ayr exports coal across the North Channel to nearby Northern Ireland, processes timber, and imports dry goods. Of the town’s educational establishments, Ayr Academy (founded 1233) is the most notable. A campus of the University of Paisley opened more recently at Ayr. Ayr remains a popular holiday resort, featuring attractions such as golf courses and horse racetracks. Robert Burns was born 3 miles (5 km) south at Alloway, now a residential suburb of Ayr and an annual place of pilgrimage for thousands of tourists. Ayr is the historic county town (seat) of Ayrshire and the principal administrative centre of South Ayrshire. Pop. (2001) 46,580; (2011) 46,850.</p></div>
