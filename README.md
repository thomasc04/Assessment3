Why I designed it like this:
I wanted to make a simplistic, tidy design that was easy to find your way around and was modern looking. 
I mainly used the colours blue and white as they look nice and I did not want it to look messy with many different colours that do not go well together.
I didnt want to overcomplicate the navigation sytems so i kept it neat and simple.
On the home page I seperated the top part in two to make sure the website looked balanced and so it was not cluttered.
For the images and text I used I put the source in the footer.

What chalanges I faced:
I struggled with linking my codio work to git hub so I asked help from a demonstrator and figured out how to link them so i could push my work to git hub.
